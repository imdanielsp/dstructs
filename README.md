# DStructs
A C++ library of data structures. The purpose of this repository is to practice my C++ skills and review data structures in general.

This idea of this repository is to review and write data structures and algorithms in C++. First I will be focused in implementation.
After implementing, I will come back and make a refactor focused on performace.

Any comments are welcome :)
